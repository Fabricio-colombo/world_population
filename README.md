# World Population Growth Analysis

From 1970 to 2023, the world population increased from 3.7 billion to 8 billion, a growth of 4.3 billion people.

So, the average annual population growth worldwide is approximately 81.132 million people per year, and the average per decade is approximately 811.321 million people per decade.

It may not be evident at first glance on the graph, but a deeper analysis of the world population reveals an interesting phenomenon: while the absolute number of inhabitants grows, the percentage growth rate per person decreases.

For example, in the period from 1970 to 1980, we observed a population increase from 3.6 billion to 4.4 billion, representing an addition of 800 million. This implies an average growth of approximately 80 million per year, considering the starting point of 3.6 billion.

When examining more recent data, such as from 2022 to 2023, we notice that the average remains similar, going from 7.9 billion to 8 billion in just one year. However, the current number of inhabitants is nearly double what it was in the 1970s. This leads us to conclude that proportionally, the growth should be double what was observed at that time.

This realization raises the question of whether, in a few years, the graph will tend to balance and possibly show a reduction in the world population.

## Global Challenge

The remaining question is: is there a sustainable maximum limit of inhabitants on the planet? If the answer is affirmative, what would that limit be? It is a complex question that involves not only demographic aspects but also environmental, economic, and social considerations.

The search for answers to this question is crucial for future planning and the sustainability of our planet. The balance between population growth and available resources becomes a global challenge that requires reflection and careful actions.
